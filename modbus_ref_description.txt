    1、 Communication using RS485 modbus RTU, asynchronous serial signal 1 start bit, 8 data bits, 2 end bits, no parity, baud rate 19200bps.

    2、 In line with the standard MODBUS RTU protocol,16-bit data structure, 16-bit CRC checksum low byte in front of the high byte in the back

    3、 The unit goes from address #l - address #8, as determined by dial codes 2-4.

    4、 The upper computer is the call host and the controller is the slave.

    5、 Three commands are used for master-slave communication:

03H（Read holding registers(4x)）
TX：[Device address] + [Command number 03H] + [Start register address high 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits] + [Number of registers read high 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits of CRC check] + [High 8 bits of CRC check]
RX：[Device address] + [Command number 03H] + [Number of bytes returned] + [Data 1] + [Data 2] +...+ [Data n] + [Low 8 bits of CRC check] + [High 8 bits of CRC check]

06H（Write single register）
TX：[Device address] + [Command number 06H] + [Register address to be downstaged high 8 bites] + [Low 8 bits] + [Data to be downstaged high 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits of CRC check] + [High 8 bits of CRC check]
RX：if successful return the command sent by the computer as it is, otherwise no response

10H（Write multiple register）
TX：[Device address] + [Command number 10H] + [Start register address high 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits] + [Number of registers read high 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits] + [Number of register bytes] + [Data 1 high 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits] +…. + [Data N high 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits of CRC check] + [High 8 bits of CRC check]
RX：[Device address] + [Command number 10H] + [Start register address high 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits] + [Number of registers read high 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits of CRC check] + [High 8 bits of CRC check] 

01H（Read Coils）
Send Command：[Device address] + [Command number 01H] + [Query bit address high 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits] + [Number of query bits high 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits of CRC check] + [High 8 bits of CRC check]
Device response：[Device address] + [Command number 01H] + [Number of bytes returned] + [Data 1] + [Data 2] +...+ [Data n] + [Low 8 bits of CRC check] + [High 8 bits of CRC check]

05H（Write Single Coil）
Send Command：[Device address] + [Command number 05H] + [Lower bit address high 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits] + [Lower data high 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits] + [Low 8 bits of CRC check] + [High 8 bits of CRC check]
Lower data [FF] [00] indicates 1[00] [00] indicates 0
Device Response: If successful return the command sent by the computer as it is, otherwise no response 

6、Modify parameters in #1 machine, other units can only query.
